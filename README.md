# REST Services

- Compulsory (all tasks done)
- Optional (all tasks done except the last one):
  - Create REST services for inserting and reading games.
  - Integrate the services into your previous project, invoking them using the support offered by Spring Boot.
  - Handle the exceptions using a RestControllerAdvice.
